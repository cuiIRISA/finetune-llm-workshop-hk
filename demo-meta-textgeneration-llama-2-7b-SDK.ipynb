The first decade of the 20th century saw increasing diplomatic tension between the European great powers. This reached breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary held Serbia responsible, and declared war on 28 July. Russia came to Serbia's defense, and by 4 August, defensive alliances had drawn in Germany, France, and Britain. German strategy in 1914 was to first defeat France, then attack Russia. However, this failed, and by the end of 1914, the Western Front consisted of a continuous line of trenches stretching from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more fluid, but neither side could gain a decisive advantage, despite a series of costly offensives. Attempts by both sides to bypass the stalemate caused fighting to expand into the Middle East, the Alps, the Balkans, and overseas colonies, bringing Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and others into the war.\\n\\n\\n\\n### Response:\\n</td>\n",

    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",

    "* **return_full_text:** If True, input text will be part of the output generated text. If specified, it must be boolean. The default value for it is False.\n",
